# TypeScript Practice Exercises

- [ ] 1. Create a function that takes two parameters of type `number` and returns their sum. Call this function with different number values and log the result.

- [ ] 2. Declare a variable of type `string | number` (union type). Assign it both a string and a number in separate statements, and log its value and type after each assignment.

- [ ] 3. Create an array that can hold both strings and numbers. Add at least two strings and two numbers to this array, then log its contents.

- [ ] 4. Write a function that takes a parameter of type `any` and returns its type as a string. Test this function with different types of values (number, string, boolean, array, object).

- [ ] 5. Create an enum for days of the week. Then write a function that takes a day as a parameter and returns whether it's a weekday or weekend.

- [ ] 6. Define an interface for a `Car` with properties for `make` (string), `model` (string), and `year` (number). Create an object based on this interface and log its properties.

- [ ] 7. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.

- [ ] 8. Create a tuple type for representing a point in 2D space (x and y coordinates). Create a function that takes two points and calculates the distance between them.

- [ ] 9. Define a type alias for a function that takes two numbers and returns a boolean. Then create a function of this type that checks if the first number is greater than the second.

- [ ] 10. Create a generic function that takes an array of any type and returns the first element of the array. Test this function with arrays of different types.
